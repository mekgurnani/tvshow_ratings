# ðŸ“º TV Show Ratings Explorer

**Tired of getting spoilers from friends but still want to know if the episode was worth it?**  
This app lets you explore the highs and lows of your favorite TV shows with a season-by-season breakdown of episode ratings â€” visualized as an interactive heatmap.

## Why I Built This

I built this app to create a fun and intuitive way to visualize how shows evolve over time â€” not just based on overall ratings, but episode by episode. While platforms like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes provide summaries, they rarely offer a detailed view of where a show dipped or peaked seasonally â€” and they often leave you with spoilers.

This tool helps:
- Identify the best and worst seasons at a glance
- Decide whether to keep watching or skip ahead
- Make TV discussions more data-driven (yes, even for *Greyâ€™s Anatomy*)
